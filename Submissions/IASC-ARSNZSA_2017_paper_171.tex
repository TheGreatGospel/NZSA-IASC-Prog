\noindent {\bf Abstract}. Gene-environment interactions (GEI) are known to be one possible avenue for addressing the missing heritability problem in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Although many statistical methods have been proposed for identifying and analyzing GEI, most of these consider interactions between a single genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) by the environment. In this study, we proposed a new statistical method for gene-based GEI analysis, Hierarchical structural CoMponent analysis of Gene-Environment Interaction (HisCoM-GEI). HisCoM-GEI is based on generalized structured component analysis, and can consider hierarchical structural relationships among SNPs in a gene. HisCoM-GEI can effectively aggregate all possible pairwise SNP-Environment interactions into a latent variable by imposing a ridge penalty, from which it then performs GEI analysis. Furthermore, HisCoM-GEI can evaluate both gene-level and SNP-level analyses. We applied the HisCoM-GEI to the cohort data of the Korea Associated Resource (KARE) consortium to identify GEIs between genes and alcohol intake on the blood pressure traits.

%\section{ First-level heading}
%The C98 head 1 style leaves a half-line spacing below a
%first-level heading. There should be one blank line above
%a first-level heading.
%        
%\subsection { Second-level heading}
%There should also be one blank line above a second- or
%third-level heading (but no extra space below them).
%
%Do not intent the first paragraph following a heading.
%Second and subsequent paragraphs are indented by one Tab
%character (= 3 mm). If footnotes are used, they should be
%placed at the foot of the page\footnote{ Footnotes are separated
%from the text by a blank line and a printed line of length 3.5 cm.
%They should be printed in 9-point Times Roman in single line spacing.}.
%        
%\subsubsection { Third-level heading}
%Please specify references using the conventions
%illustrated below. Each should begin on a new line, and
%second and subsequent lines should be on the same page
%indented by 3 mm.
