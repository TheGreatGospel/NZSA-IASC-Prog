\noindent {\bf Abstract}.A case-cohort design is an efficient study design for analyzing failure time data by
reducing the cost and effort of conducting a large cohort study. 
Estimation of regression coefficients is typically done through a weighted estimating equation approach 
whose weight is the inverse of the sampling probabilities. Several techniques to enhance the efficiency
by estimating weights or calibrating weights based on auxiliary variables have been developed 
for Cox models. In this paper, we propose to extend these methodologies to semiparametric
additive hazards models. The proposed estimators are demonstrated to be more efficient, via simulation studies, than the usual Horvitz-Thompson type estimator.
We illustrate a use of the proposed estimators by using the National Wilms Tumor Study data.

%\section{ First-level heading}
%The C98 head 1 style leaves a half-line spacing below a
%first-level heading. There should be one blank line above
%a first-level heading.
%        
%\subsection { Second-level heading}
%There should also be one blank line above a second- or
%third-level heading (but no extra space below them).
%
%Do not intent the first paragraph following a heading.
%Second and subsequent paragraphs are indented by one Tab
%character (= 3 mm). If footnotes are used, they should be
%placed at the foot of the page\footnote{ Footnotes are separated
%from the text by a blank line and a printed line of length 3.5 cm.
%They should be printed in 9-point Times Roman in single line spacing.}.
%        
%\subsubsection { Third-level heading}
%Please specify references using the conventions
%illustrated below. Each should begin on a new line, and
%second and subsequent lines should be on the same page
%indented by 3 mm.
