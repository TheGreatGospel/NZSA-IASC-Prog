\noindent {\bf Abstract}. Spatial scan statistics are widely used for cluster detection analysis in geographical 
disease surveillance. While the method has been developed for various types of data such as binary, count and 
continuous data, spatial scan statistics for matched case-control data, which often arise in spatial epidemiology, 
have not been considered yet. In this paper, we propose two spatial scan statistics for matched case-control data. 
The proposed test statistics properly consider the correlations between matched pairs. We evaluate statistical power 
and cluster detection accuracy of the proposed methods through simulations comparing with the Bernoulli-based method. 
We illustrate the methods with the use of a real data example.
