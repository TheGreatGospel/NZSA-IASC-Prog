\noindent {\bf Abstract}. 
To discern potential impacts of global warming for New Zealand, it is imperative to accurately estimate long-term temperature trends. Here we analyse annual average temperature time series measured at several locations in New Zealand. The data are from a set of climate stations with no significant site changes since the 1930s. We specify a hierarchical semi-parametric model with a linear time and changepoints at known time points where re-siting of recorders or changes in instrumentation occurred. The power spectral density of the errors is estimated using a Bayesian nonparametric approach based on Whittleâ€™s likelihood.  We use a nonparametric Bernstein polynomial prior on the spectral density with weights induced by a Dirichlet process. 
Posterior computation is implemented using a MH-within-Gibbs algorithm. We compare our results to those obtained by OLS and GLS.

%\section{ First-level heading}
%The C98 head 1 style leaves a half-line spacing below a
%first-level heading. There should be one blank line above
%a first-level heading.
%        
%\subsection { Second-level heading}
%There should also be one blank line above a second- or
%third-level heading (but no extra space below them).
%
%Do not intent the first paragraph following a heading.
%Second and subsequent paragraphs are indented by one Tab
%character (= 3 mm). If footnotes are used, they should be
%placed at the foot of the page\footnote{ Footnotes are separated
%from the text by a blank line and a printed line of length 3.5 cm.
%They should be printed in 9-point Times Roman in single line spacing.}.
%        
%\subsubsection { Third-level heading}
%Please specify references using the conventions
%illustrated below. Each should begin on a new line, and
%second and subsequent lines should be on the same page
%indented by 3 mm.
