\noindent {\bf Abstract}. In spite of recent growing interest in applying the von-Mises distribution to circular data in various scientific fields, researches on the parameter estimation are surprisingly sparse.
 The standard estimators are the MLE and the maximum marginal likelihood estimator (Schou 1978).
 Although Bayesian estimators are promising, it looks that they have not been fully developed.
 We propose the posterior mean of the canonical parameter, instead of the mean parameter, under the reference prior.
 This estimator satisfies an optimality property, and performs favorably for wide ranges of true parameters.
 Extensive simulation studies yield that the risks of the proposed estimator are significantly small, compared with the existing estimators.
 An interesting finding is that the estimating function for the dispersion parameter behaves reasonably.
 Notable advantages of the present approach are its straightforward extensions to various procedures, including Bayesian estimator under an informative prior based on the reference prior.
 The proposed estimator is examined by applying to practical datasets.

%\section{ First-level heading}
%The C98 head 1 style leaves a half-line spacing below a
%first-level heading. There should be one blank line above
%a first-level heading.
%        
%\subsection { Second-level heading}
%There should also be one blank line above a second- or
%third-level heading (but no extra space below them).
%
%Do not intent the first paragraph following a heading.
%Second and subsequent paragraphs are indented by one Tab
%character (= 3 mm). If footnotes are used, they should be
%placed at the foot of the page\footnote{ Footnotes are separated
%from the text by a blank line and a printed line of length 3.5 cm.
%They should be printed in 9-point Times Roman in single line spacing.}.
%        
%\subsubsection { Third-level heading}
%Please specify references using the conventions
%illustrated below. Each should begin on a new line, and
%second and subsequent lines should be on the same page
%indented by 3 mm.
