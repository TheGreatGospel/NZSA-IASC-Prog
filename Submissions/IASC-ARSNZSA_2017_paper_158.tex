\noindent {\bf Abstract}. We introduce different representations of a new model for time series based on repeated application of a filter to the original data.
They can represent correlation structure to higher lags with fewer coefficients and they can provide a robust prediction at higher lead times.

\noindent {\bf Keywords}.
Time series, smooting, parsimonious models


%\section{ First-level heading}
%The C98 head 1 style leaves a half-line spacing below a
%first-level heading. There should be one blank line above
%a first-level heading.
%
%\subsection { Second-level heading}
%There should also be one blank line above a second- or
%third-level heading (but no extra space below them).
%
%Do not intent the first paragraph following a heading.
%Second and subsequent paragraphs are indented by one Tab
%character (= 3 mm). If footnotes are used, they should be
%placed at the foot of the page\footnote{ Footnotes are separated
%from the text by a blank line and a printed line of length 3.5 cm.
%They should be printed in 9-point Times Roman in single line spacing.}.
%
%\subsubsection { Third-level heading}
%Please specify references using the conventions
%illustrated below. Each should begin on a new line, and
%second and subsequent lines should be on the same page
%indented by 3 mm.
