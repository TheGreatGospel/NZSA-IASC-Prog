\noindent {\bf Abstract}. For the purpose of feature selection in ultra-high dimensional regression models, it is required that a sequence of candidate models and a criterion to select the ``best'' model from them are available. Under different scenarios, various methods have been proposed to achieve these two goals. Intuitively, it is straightforward to choose appropriate loss and penalty functions in a regularization method to accommodate specific characteristics of the data. However, the computation could be expensive for certain cases. From recent studies, we can see that sequential method is promising to produce good candidate models for ultra-high dimensional data. Moreover, it can be easily extended to complex models other than the linear regression model. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection method based on robust estimation.

%\section{ First-level heading}
%The C98 head 1 style leaves a half-line spacing below a
%first-level heading. There should be one blank line above
%a first-level heading.
%
%\subsection { Second-level heading}
%There should also be one blank line above a second- or
%third-level heading (but no extra space below them).
%
%Do not intent the first paragraph following a heading.
%Second and subsequent paragraphs are indented by one Tab
%character (= 3 mm). If footnotes are used, they should be
%placed at the foot of the page\footnote{ Footnotes are separated
%from the text by a blank line and a printed line of length 3.5 cm.
%They should be printed in 9-point Times Roman in single line spacing.}.
%
%\subsubsection { Third-level heading}
%Please specify references using the conventions
%illustrated below. Each should begin on a new line, and
%second and subsequent lines should be on the same page
%indented by 3 mm.
