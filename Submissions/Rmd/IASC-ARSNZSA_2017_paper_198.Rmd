<span>**Abstract:**</span> Since the introduction of R, research in Statistical Computing has
plateaued. Although R is, at best, a stop-gap system, there appears to
be very little active research on creating better computing
environments for Statistics.

When work on R commenced there were a multitude of software systems
for statistical data analysis in use and under development. There was
friendly competition and collaboration between developers. While R can
be seen as providing a useful unification for users, its success and
dominance can be viewed as now holding back research and the
development of new systems.

In this talk we'll examine what might be behind this and also look at
some research aimed at exploring some of the design space for new
systems. The aim is to show constructively that new work in the area
is still possible.
