Testing Volatility in Clustered Multiple Time Series: A Nonparametric
Approach

Erniel B. Barrios and Paolo Victor T. Redondo School of Statistics,
University of the Philippines Diliman Abstract

We proposed a test for volatility in clustered multiple time series
based on sieve bootstrap. Clustering of observations is intended to
capture contagion effect in multiple time series data, assumed to be
present in the data generating process where the test is based from. We
designed a simulation study to evaluate the test procedure. The method
is further illustrated using data on global stock prices and rice
production among Asian countries. The test is potentially robust to some
distributional assumption but is possibly affected by the nature of
volatility.
