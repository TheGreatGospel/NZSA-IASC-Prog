<span>**Abstract**</span>. To discern potential impacts of global
warming for New Zealand, it is imperative to accurately estimate
long-term temperature trends. Here we analyse annual average temperature
time series measured at several locations in New Zealand. The data are
from a set of climate stations with no significant site changes since
the 1930s. We specify a hierarchical semi-parametric model with a linear
time and changepoints at known time points where re-siting of recorders
or changes in instrumentation occurred. The power spectral density of
the errors is estimated using a Bayesian nonparametric approach based on
Whittleâ€™s likelihood. We use a nonparametric Bernstein polynomial prior
on the spectral density with weights induced by a Dirichlet process.
Posterior computation is implemented using a MH-within-Gibbs algorithm.
We compare our results to those obtained by OLS and GLS.
