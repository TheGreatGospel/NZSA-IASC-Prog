<span>**Abstract**</span>. The confidence or the credible interval of
the binomial proportion $p$ is one of most widely employed statistical
analysis methods, and a variety of methods have been proposed. The
Bayesian credible interval attracts recent researchesâ€™ attentions. One
of the promising methods is the highest posterior density (HPD)
interval, which implies the shortest possible interval enclosing
$100(1-\alpha)$% of the probability density function. The HPD interval
is often used because it is narrow compared to other credible intervals.
However, the HPD interval has some drawbacks when the binomial
proportion is a small. To dissolve them, we calculate first a credible
interval by the HPD interval of the logit transformed parameter,
$\theta=\log\{p/(1-p)\}$, instead of $p$. Note that $\theta$ and $p$ are
the canonical and the mean parameters of the binomial distribution in
the exponential family, respectively. Writing the HPD interval of
$\theta$ as $(\theta_{l}, \theta_{u})$, we define the proposed credible
interval of $p$ as
$(p_{l}, p_{u})= \big( e^{\theta_{l}} / ( 1+e^{\theta_{l}} ), \,  e^{\theta_{u}}/(1+e^{\theta_{u}}) \big)$.
It is explored in depth, and numerical comparison studies are conducted
to confirm its favorable performance, especially when the observed
number is small, such as 0 or 1. Practical datasets are analyzed to
examine the potential usefulness for applications in medical fields.
