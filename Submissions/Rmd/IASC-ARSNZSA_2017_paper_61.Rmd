<span>**Abstract**</span>. Estimating the density of animal populations
is of central importance in ecology, with practical applications that
affect decision making in the fields of wildlife management,
conservation, and beyond. For species that vocalise, surveys using
acoustic detectors such as microphones, hydrophones, or human observers
can be vastly cheaper than traditional surveys that physically capture
or visually detect animals. In this talk I describe a spatial
capture-recapture approach to estimate animal density from acoustic
surveys and present a software implementation in the R package `ascr`,
with examples applied to populations of frogs, gibbons, and whales.
