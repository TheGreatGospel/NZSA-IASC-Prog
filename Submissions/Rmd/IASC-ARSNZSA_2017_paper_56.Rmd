<span>**Abstract**</span>. Suppose that there are multiple heterogeneous
subgroups in a dataset. In the “Big data” era, this would be a natural
assumption for many fields of application such as medicine, biology,
marketing, psychology, etc. Then, conventional linear regression models
result in not only poor prediction performance but also misleading
interpretation of analyses. In this study, we propose an extension of
cluster-wise regression models
$\phi^{-1}\left(\sum_{k=1}^Kp_k(\vec{x})\phi(\vec{\beta}_k^\top\vec{x})\right)$,
where $\phi$ is a strictly increasing function,
$\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^d$, $\vec{\beta}_k$ is a regression coefficient
for $k$th cluster and $p_k(\vec{x})$ is a non-negative function
satisfying $\sum_{k=1}^Kp_k(\vec{x})=1$ for any $\vec{x}$. We show that
the proposed model has flexibility in clustering and “averaging”
multiple regressors and hence includes the existing methods such as
Späth (1981), DeSarbo et al. (1989) as special cases.
