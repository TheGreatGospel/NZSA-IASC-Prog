<span>**Abstract**</span>. To study the feature of default clustering in
credit risk management, this paper evaluates joint default probabilities
and default correlation for multiple firms through the classical default
barrier structure form model. Under the commonly used factor model, by
making use of a developed renewal theory, we provide a closed form
approximation for the joint default probability, default correlation and
expected default time, both for a specific firm as well as the first to
default among a group of firms. Moreover, based on the approximated
default correlation and expected default time, we propose a multi-name
Distance-to-Default, which can be used to explain the feature of
corporate default clustering: contagion and co-movement. Numerical
studies for evaluating a multi-name Distance-to-Default are given to
illustrate our model.
