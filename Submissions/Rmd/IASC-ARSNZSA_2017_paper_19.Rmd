<span>**Abstract**</span>. Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods have been
heavily exploited to analyse the association between two blocs of data.
These powerful approaches can be applied to data sets where the number
of variables is greater than the number of observations and in presence
of high collinearity between variables. Different sparse versions of PLS
have been developed to integrate multiple data sets while simultaneously
selecting the contributing variables. Sparse modelling is a key factor
in obtaining better estimators and identifying associations between
multiple data sets. The cornerstone of the sparsity version of PLS
methods is the link between the SVD of a matrix (constructed from
deflated versions of the original matrices of data) and least squares
minimisation in linear regression. We present here an accurate
description of the most popular PLS methods, alongside their
mathematical proofs. A unified algorithm is proposed to perform all four
types of PLS including their regularised versions. Various approaches to
decrease the computation time are offered, and we show how the whole
procedure can be scalable to big data sets.
