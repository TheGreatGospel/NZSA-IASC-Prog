<span>**Abstract**</span>. Everyone knows I love R. So much that I never
want to leave the friendly environs of R and RStudio. Want to download a
file? Use `download.file`. Want to create a directory? Use `dir.create`.
Sending an email? `gmailr`. Using Git? `git2r`. Building this slideshow?
`rmarkdown`. Writing a book? `knitr`. Letâ€™s take a look at everyday
activities that can be done in R.

<span>**Keywords**</span>. R, RMarkdown, knitr, email, football, git,
download, data, plotting, modeling, logistic regression
