<span>**Abstract**</span>. One of the difficulties in detecting the
change boundary in a random field is the implementation, especially when
the random disturbances have heavy-tailed distributions. Thank to the
gearing of the digital technology, a huge amount of image data can be
easily obtained and analyzed. So far, in the case of star-shape
boundaries (e.g. circular or elliptical), some well-known methods which
deal with random fields in Cartesian coordinate cannot be directly
applied. In particular, among the existed approaches, none is
computationally efficient in detecting a change boundary in a random
field. Based on Chengâ€™s work (\[1\]), we propose a modified
computationally efficient method to detect the star-shaped change
boundaries in a polar coordinated random field with heavy-tailed
distribution.
