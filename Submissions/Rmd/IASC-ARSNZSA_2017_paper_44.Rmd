<span>**Abstract**</span>. In contrast to previous model dividing
necessity entrepreneurs as individuals facing push factors due to lack
of employment, we consider the possibility of push factors faced by
employed individuals (Folta et al. (2010)). The theoretical model yields
distinctive predictions relating occupation characteristics and the
probability of entry into entrepreneurship. Using PSED and ONET data, we
investigate how the characteristics of individuals? primary occupations
affect nascent entrepreneurs? effort put into venture creation. The
empirical evidences show that necessity entrepreneurs are not only
confined to unemployed individuals. We find compelling evidence that
individuals facing arduous working conditions (e.g. stressful
environment and physical tiredness) have a higher likelihood of entering
and succeeding in self-employment than others. Contrariwise, individuals
who experience high degree of self-realization, independence and
responsibility in the workplace are less committed to their business
than individuals exposed to arduous working conditions. These findings
have strong implication for how we interpret and analyze necessity
entrepreneurs and provide novel insights into the role of occupational
experience in the process of venture emergence.
