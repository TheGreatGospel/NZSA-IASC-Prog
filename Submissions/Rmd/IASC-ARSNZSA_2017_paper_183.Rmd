<span>**Abstract**</span>. Count data with excess zeros are common in
epidemiological studies. Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model or
zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model can be usually used in
these cases. From Bayesian perspective, however, the ZIP and ZINB models
are not straightforward to fit, usually requiring manual tunings in the
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We consider the auxiliary mixture
sampling through several data augmentations that effectively transform
the non-linear and non-Gaussian problem in zero-inflated regression
model into a set of linear and Gaussian one. The auxiliary mixture
sampling results in tuning-free algorithms in MCMC. We demonstrate how
the auxiliary mixture sampling can be applied to an epidemiological case
study.
