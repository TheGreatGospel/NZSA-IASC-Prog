<span>**Abstract**</span>. Vector autoregression (VAR) model is powerful
in economic data analysis because it can be used to analyze several
different time series data simultaneously. However, in VAR model, we
need to deal with the huge coefficient dimensionality and it would be
caused some computational problems for coefficient inference. To reduce
the dimensionality, we could take some model structures into account
based on the prior knowledge. In this paper, several group structures of
the coefficient matrices are considered. Due to different types of VAR
structures, corresponding MCMC algorithms are proposed to generate
posterior samples for making inference of the structure selection.
Simulation studies and a real example are used to show the performances
of the proposed Bayesian approaches.
