Including questions about sexual health in the annual Health Survey for
England (HSE) provides opportunities for regular measurement of key
public health indicators, augmenting Britain's decennial National Survey
of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal). However, contextual and
methodological differences may limit comparability of the findings. For
instance both surveys used self-completion for administering sexual
behaviour questions but this was via computer-assisted self-interview
(CASI) in Natsal-3 and a pen-and-paper questionnaire in HSE 2010. We
examine the extent of these differences between HSE 2010 and Natsal-3
(undertaken 2010-2012) and investigate their impact on parameter
estimates. For inclusion to this study, we restricted participants to
men and women in the 2010 HSE (n = 2,782 men and 3,588 women) and
Natsal-3 (n = 4,882 men and 6,869 women) aged 16-69 years and resident
in England. We compared their demographic characteristics, the amount of
non-response to, and estimates from, sexual health questions. We used
complex survey analysis to take into account stratification, clustering,
and weighting of the data in each survey. Logistic regression was used
to measure the extent to which sexual health estimates differ in HSE
2010 relative to Natsal-3, with multivariable models to adjust for
significant demographic confounders. Additionally, investigated
age-group interactions to see if differences between the surveys varied
by age. The surveys achieved similar response rates, both around 60%,
and demographic profiles largely consistent with the census, although
HSE participants tended to be less educated, and reported worse general
health, than Natsal-3 participants. Item non-response to the sexual
health questions was typically higher in HSE 2010 (range: 9-18%)
relative to Natsal-3 (all &lt;5%). Reported age at 1st intercourse was
comparable in the two surveys: medians of 17 (men) and 16 (women) aged
16-24. However, for some sensitive questions there were lower levels of
reporting in HSE2010 than in Natsal-3: while the proportion reporting
same-sex in the last 5 years was similar (2-3%), reporting of ever
having same-sex was lower in HSE2010 for men (2% vs 5% in Natsal-3).
Similarly, the mean number of opposite-sex partners reported in HSE2010
was a little lower than in Natsal-3, particularly for men: 9.5 vs 12.7,
respectively; (5.4 vs 6.5 for women, respectively). Men were also
slightly less likely to report STI diagnoses in HSE2010 vs Natsal-3:
8.0% vs 13.2%, respectively. While a relatively high response to sexual
health questions in HSE 2010 demonstrates the feasibility of asking such
questions in a general health survey, differences with Natsal-3 do
exist. These are likely due to the HSE's context as a general health
survey and methodological limitations such as its current use of
pen-and-paper questionnaires.
