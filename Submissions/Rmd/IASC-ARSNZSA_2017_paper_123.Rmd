<span>**Abstract**</span>. A variety of computationally efficient
Bayesian models for the covariance matrix of a multivariate Gaussian
distribution are available. However, all produce a relatively dense
estimate of the precision matrix, and are therefore unsatisfactory when
one wishes to use the precision matrix to consider the conditional
independence structure of the data. This talk considers the posterior of
model fit for these covariance models. We then undertake post-processing
of the Bayes point estimate for the precision matrix to produce a sparse
model whose expected fit lies within the upper 95% of the posterior over
fits. Extensions to finding sparse differences between inverse
covariance matrices are also considered. We illustrate our findings with
moderate dimensional data examples from metabolomics.
