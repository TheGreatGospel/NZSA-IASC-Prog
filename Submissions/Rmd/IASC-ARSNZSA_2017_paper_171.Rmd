<span>**Abstract**</span>. Gene-environment interactions (GEI) are known
to be one possible avenue for addressing the missing heritability
problem in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Although many
statistical methods have been proposed for identifying and analyzing
GEI, most of these consider interactions between a single genetic
variants such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) by the
environment. In this study, we proposed a new statistical method for
gene-based GEI analysis, Hierarchical structural CoMponent analysis of
Gene-Environment Interaction (HisCoM-GEI). HisCoM-GEI is based on
generalized structured component analysis, and can consider hierarchical
structural relationships among SNPs in a gene. HisCoM-GEI can
effectively aggregate all possible pairwise SNP-Environment interactions
into a latent variable by imposing a ridge penalty, from which it then
performs GEI analysis. Furthermore, HisCoM-GEI can evaluate both
gene-level and SNP-level analyses. We applied the HisCoM-GEI to the
cohort data of the Korea Associated Resource (KARE) consortium to
identify GEIs between genes and alcohol intake on the blood pressure
traits.
