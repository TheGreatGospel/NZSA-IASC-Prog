<span>**Abstract**</span>. Estimating disease trajectories has
increasingly become more essential to clinical practitioners to
administer effective treatment to their patients. A part of describing
disease trajectories involves taking patients’ medical histories and
sociodemographic factors into account and grouping them into similar
groups, or clusters. Advances in computerised patient databases have
paved a way for identifying such trajectories in patients by recording a
patient’s medical history over a long period of time (longitudinal
data): we studied data from the PREDICT-CVD dataset, a national
primary-care cohort from which people with diabetes from 2002-2015 were
identified through routine clinical practice. We fitted a Bayesian
hierarchical linear model with latent clusters to the repeated
measurements of HbA$_1c$ and eGFR, using the Markov birth-death process
proposed by Stephens (2000) to handle the changes in dimensionality as
clusters were added or removed.
