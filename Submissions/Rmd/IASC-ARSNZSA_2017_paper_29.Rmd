<span>**Abstract**</span>. A genetic linkage map shows the relative
position of and genetic distance between markers, positions of the
genome that exhibit variation, and underpins the study of speciesâ€™
genomes in a number of scientific applications. Genetic maps are
constructed by tracking the transmission of genetic information from
individuals to their offspring, which is frequently modelled using a
hidden Markov model (HMM) since only the expression and not the
transmission of genetic information is observed. However, constructing
genetic maps with data generated using the latest sequencing technology
is complicated by the fact that some observations are only partially
observed which, if unaccounted for, typically results in inflated
estimates. We extend the HMM to model partially observed information by
including an additional layer of latent variables. In addition, we
investigate several different approaches for computing confidence
intervals of the genetic map estimates obtained from the extended HMM.
Results show that our model is able to produce accurate genetic map
estimates, even in situations where a large proportion of the data is
only partially observed. Our methodology has been implemented in the R
package GusMap.
