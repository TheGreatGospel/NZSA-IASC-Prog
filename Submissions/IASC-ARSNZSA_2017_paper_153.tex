\noindent {\bf Abstract}. Multivariate regression aims at the study of the relationship between one set of input variables X and one set of output variables Y.  Challenges occur when no parametric model is known and yet the number of variables is large. To overcome the difficulties, dimension reduction methods   under the inverse regression viewpoint  have been investigated by many authors.  Liquid association (LA) depicts the change in the covariation of two variables X and Y as a third variable Z varies.  In this talk, I will describe a framework to illustrate how the LA methodology can help increase the modeling flexibility of multivariate regression in analyzing complex data.

%\section{ First-level heading}
%The C98 head 1 style leaves a half-line spacing below a
%first-level heading. There should be one blank line above
%a first-level heading.
%        
%\subsection { Second-level heading}
%There should also be one blank line above a second- or
%third-level heading (but no extra space below them).
%
%Do not intent the first paragraph following a heading.
%Second and subsequent paragraphs are indented by one Tab
%character (= 3 mm). If footnotes are used, they should be
%placed at the foot of the page\footnote{ Footnotes are separated
%from the text by a blank line and a printed line of length 3.5 cm.
%They should be printed in 9-point Times Roman in single line spacing.}.
%        
%\subsubsection { Third-level heading}
%Please specify references using the conventions
%illustrated below. Each should begin on a new line, and
%second and subsequent lines should be on the same page
%indented by 3 mm.
