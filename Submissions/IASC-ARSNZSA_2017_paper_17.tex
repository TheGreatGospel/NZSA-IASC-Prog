\noindent {\bf Abstract}. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major multifactorial condition that predisposes adults to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It is defined as having at least three of five cardiometabolic risk components:  1) high fasting triglyceride level, 2) low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 3) elevated fasting plasma glucose, 4) large waist circumference (abdominal obesity) and 5) hypertension. In the US Study of Womenâ€™s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a 15-year multi-centre prospective cohort study of women from five racial/ethnic groups, the incidence of MetS increased as midlife women underwent the menopausal transition (MT). A model is sought to examine the interdependent progression of the five MetS components and the influence of demographic covariates.

%\section{ First-level heading}
%The C98 head 1 style leaves a half-line spacing below a
%first-level heading. There should be one blank line above
%a first-level heading.
%
%\subsection { Second-level heading}
%There should also be one blank line above a second- or
%third-level heading (but no extra space below them).
%
%Do not intent the first paragraph following a heading.
%Second and subsequent paragraphs are indented by one Tab
%character (= 3 mm). If footnotes are used, they should be
%placed at the foot of the page\footnote{ Footnotes are separated
%from the text by a blank line and a printed line of length 3.5 cm.
%They should be printed in 9-point Times Roman in single line spacing.}.
%
%\subsubsection { Third-level heading}
%Please specify references using the conventions
%illustrated below. Each should begin on a new line, and
%second and subsequent lines should be on the same page
%indented by 3 mm.
