\noindent {\bf Abstract}.  In this paper, a model-adaptive test statistic is proposed to do model checking for functional single-index models. Dimension reduction methods are included to handle the curse of dimensionality. The test statistic consists of two parts: the first term is a naive one, and the second term is adaptive to the model as if the model were univariate. It is consistent and can detect local alternative at a fast rate. Monte Carlo method is used to find the critical value under null hypothesis. Simulation studies show the performance of our proposed test procedure.

%\section{ First-level heading}
%The C98 head 1 style leaves a half-line spacing below a
%first-level heading. There should be one blank line above
%a first-level heading.
%
%\subsection { Second-level heading}
%There should also be one blank line above a second- or
%third-level heading (but no extra space below them).
%
%Do not intent the first paragraph following a heading.
%Second and subsequent paragraphs are indented by one Tab
%character (= 3 mm). If footnotes are used, they should be
%placed at the foot of the page\footnote{ Footnotes are separated
%from the text by a blank line and a printed line of length 3.5 cm.
%They should be printed in 9-point Times Roman in single line spacing.}.
%
%\subsubsection { Third-level heading}
%Please specify references using the conventions
%illustrated below. Each should begin on a new line, and
%second and subsequent lines should be on the same page
%indented by 3 mm.
