\noindent {\bf Abstract}. 
%If an abstract is included, it should be set in the same type as the main text, with the same line width and line spacing, starting 15 lines (typewriter) or 5 cm (PC) below the top of the print area; otherwise the first heading starts here.
The textile set is defined from the textile plot proposed by Kumasaka and Shibata (2007, 2008), which is a powerful tool for visualizing high dimensional data. The textile plot is based on a parallel coordinate plot, where the ordering, locations and scales of each axis are simultaneously chosen so that all connecting lines, each of which signifies an observation, are aligned as horizontally as possible. The textile plot transforms a data matrix in order to delineate a parallel coordinate plot. 
%The aim of the present study is to investigate the structure of the textile set from a geometric point of view. 
Using the geometric properties of the textile set derived by Sei and Tanaka (2015), we show that the textile set describes an intrinsically geometric structures of data.

%\section{ First-level heading}
%The C98 head 1 style leaves a half-line spacing below a first-level heading. There should be one blank line above a first-level heading.

%\subsection { Second-level heading}
%There should also be one blank line above a second- or third-level heading (but no extra space below them).
%
%Do not intent the first paragraph following a heading. Second and subsequent paragraphs are indented by one Tab character (= 3 mm). If footnotes are used, they should be placed at the foot of the page\footnote{ Footnotes are separated from the text by a blank line and a printed line of length 3.5 cm. They should be printed in 9-point Times Roman in single line spacing.}.
%        
%\subsubsection { Third-level heading}
%Please specify references using the conventions illustrated below. Each should begin on a new line, and second and subsequent lines should be on the same page indented by 3 mm.
