      Abstract
	Suppose that the time series data is sufficiently explained by a model, e.g., autoregressive model, transfer function model. A change-point is considered to exist if any of the model parameters is substantially different in two or more regimes. We proposed a test for existence of a change-point (assuming that location of the change is known) based on nonparametric bootstrap. The method is used in verifying whether the southern oscillation index exhibits change-point which is taken as an evidence of climate change. There is indeed an evidence of climate change in the period.  
Keywords: change-point analysis, block bootstrap, southern oscillation index (SOI)
