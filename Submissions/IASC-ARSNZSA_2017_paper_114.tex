\noindent {\bf Abstract}. We will discuss in this talk a new construction for a class of distribution free goodness of fit tests for the classical problem: testing independence in contingency tables. 
The point is that this problem has been stayed with only one asymptotically distribution free goodness of fit test for a long time, the chi-square test. We will show that our class 
of new distribution free goodness of fit tests is very wide and discuss the cases where the new tests perform better than the conventional chi-square test.

%\section{ First-level heading}
%The C98 head 1 style leaves a half-line spacing below a
%first-level heading. There should be one blank line above
%a first-level heading.
%        
%\subsection { Second-level heading}
%There should also be one blank line above a second- or
%third-level heading (but no extra space below them).
%
%Do not intent the first paragraph following a heading.
%Second and subsequent paragraphs are indented by one Tab
%character (= 3 mm). If footnotes are used, they should be
%placed at the foot of the page\footnote{ Footnotes are separated
%from the text by a blank line and a printed line of length 3.5 cm.
%They should be printed in 9-point Times Roman in single line spacing.}.
%        
%\subsubsection { Third-level heading}
%Please specify references using the conventions
%illustrated below. Each should begin on a new line, and
%second and subsequent lines should be on the same page
%indented by 3 mm.
