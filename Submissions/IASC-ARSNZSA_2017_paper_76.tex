\noindent {\bf Abstract}

Monitoring dose patterns over time helps physicians and patients learn more about metabolic change, disease evolution, etc. One way to turn such longitudinal data into clinically useful information is through cluster analysis, which aims to separate the ``profiles of doses'' among patients into homogeneous subgroups. Different doses patterns reflect heterogeneity in patients' characteristics and effectiveness of therapy.  However, not all patients were prescribed at regular time points, and missing values seems ubiquitous if one aligns records at distinct time points. Moreover, a few outliers may heavily influence the estimation for within and/or between variations of clusters, making the distinction among clusters blurred. In this study, a simple method based on a novel pairwise dissimilarity is proposed, which also serves as a screen tool to detect potential outliers. We use smoothing splines, handling data observed either at regular or irregular time points, and measure the dissimilarity between patients based on pairwise varying curve estimates with  commutation of smoothing parameters. It takes into account the estimation uncertainty  and is not strongly affected by outliers. The effectiveness of our proposal is shown by simulations comparing it to other dissimilarity measures and by a real application to methadone dosage maintenance levels.
